# Temperature Monitoring System

## Overview

The Temperature Monitoring System is a project powered by ESP microcontrollers and a dedicated API, designed for efficient temperature data collection and storage. This system enables users to monitor and graphically visualize temperature trends over time, providing valuable insights into environmental conditions.

## Features

- **ESP Microcontrollers:** Utilize ESP microcontrollers for accurate and real-time temperature monitoring.

- **Dedicated API:** The system comes with a dedicated API for seamless communication between the ESP devices and the data storage backend.

- **Efficient Storage:** Temperature records are efficiently stored, allowing users to access historical data and analyze trends.

- **Graphical Visualization:** The system provides graphical visualization tools to help users interpret temperature data trends easily.

## Getting Started

## Usage

1. Access the dedicated API to view real-time temperature data and historical records.

2. Utilize the graphical visualization tools provided by the system to analyze temperature trends.

3. Customize the system according to your requirements through the API configuration.
